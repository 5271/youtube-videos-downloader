# Youtube videos downloader

This is a gui program that lets you create a list of youtube videos and download all of them with a click of a button.

### Using on windows

To use the program on windows you need to install youtube-dl from this link https://yt-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl.exe. Then place the file in the directory you want and then put the directory to that file in the proper text box.

### Using on linux

To use the program on linux you just need to type this command `sudo apt install youtube-dl` and it should work.

##### If you have any problems feel free to message me about it. I'm keen to help :3

###### Until this line of text is here it means that the program is not finished and it doesn't work yet.
